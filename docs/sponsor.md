# Sponsor

Both Craft.js and Reka are licensed under MIT and is made with 100% love. In July 2022, I left my full-time job and in that time, I built the initial version of Reka.

If you found these projects valuable, and you would like to help me out - please consider sponsoring/donating to the project. Your contribution would mean a lot to me!

You can choose to sponsor via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/craftjs), [Patreon](patreon.com/imprev) or [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/prevwong)
